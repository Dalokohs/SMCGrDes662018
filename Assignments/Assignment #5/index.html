				Hey young world, the world is yours
				Hey young world

				"Yo peep this"

				 Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
				But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
				You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
				Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
				Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
				And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
				Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
				You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
				steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
				plus, a must so... bigshot you're not
				Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
				You didn't know? Go steal and rob
				And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
				You see you're actin like this urge is demandin
				C'mon, wake up... have some understandin
				Society's a weak excuse for a man
				It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
				Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you deep
				Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
				past the age of... a little child, that's true
				But folks your age don't act like you do, so
				so be mature... and put the point to a halt
				And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
				Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
				Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
				Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
				And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
				So be more mature... and kids do your chores
				Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
				You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
				Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
				And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
				Cause righteous laws are overdue
				And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
				And it's true

				"You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
				We like to party, like to party"
